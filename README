RESOLVED
*	got a cube to draw
*	fixed an error with the index buffer in infi_vertices_t
*	finished a WaveFront loader

TO-DO
!!! program frequently stalls on quit in Cygwin
!!	redo the low level indexable_t structure
	it is difficult to convert from one type to another
*	when a texture is rendered to, its mipmap levels are
	not updated
*	fix UsingRender ordering
?	commit objects by name to allow for global access
	e.g. InfiCreateProgram( "HelloWorld" );
		 Program prog = InfiProgram( "HelloWorld" );
??	make each instance of the engine it's own object?
		that way there is no need to reset the global variables
		whenever InfiMain is recalled

TO-DO
!!!	key presses don't WORK
!! 	destroy objects intelligently
! 	handle canvas format and output format match-up
* 	handle possibility of reading and writing from the same
		texture in the same render pass
* 	need to implement text namespace
* 	transform feedback
? 	patterns

WHAT'S NEW??
* Better control of what objects can be rendered with others
* Pushed all GL calls to the last possible minute, to negate
	any possibility of incorrectly ordered commands
* Updated the keyboard/mouse API
* No longer able to render individual vertex buffers; they
	must be encapsulated by a vertex object
* Cleaned up program uniforms; now able to pass in functions
	to update every time the program is bound
* Fixed the segfaults in the string_t class
* Made a few adjustments to the infi_extension_t class,
	pushed the separate methods to different classes
* Changed the inheritance structure of a few of the core
	classes (array_t, data_t)
* Began process of moving away from SDL_image; started using
	libjpeg
* Overhauled the error system, now records an error stack
	to make error locating more precise
