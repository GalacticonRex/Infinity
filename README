TO-DO
!!!	key presses don't WORK

! 	handle canvas format and output format match-up
* 	handle possibility of reading and writing from the same
		texture in the same render pass
* 	need to implement text namespace

WHAT'S NEW??
* Better control of what objects can be rendered with others
* Pushed all GL calls to the last possible minute, to negate
	any possibility of incorrectly ordered commands
* Updated the keyboard/mouse API
* No longer able to render individual vertex buffers; they
	must be encapsulated by a vertex object
* Cleaned up program uniforms; now able to pass in functions
	to update every time the program is bound
* Fixed the segfaults in the string_t class
* Made a few adjustments to the infi_extension_t class,
	pushed the separate methods to different classes
* Changed the inheritance structure of a few of the core
	classes (array_t, data_t)
* Began process of moving away from SDL_image; started using
	libjpeg
* Overhauled the error system, now records an error stack
	to make error locating more precise
